## Knight’s Tour Using a Neural Network  
A simulation of a neural network approach to solving the **Knight’s Tour Problem** on an `n x n` chessboard. Each valid knight move is modeled as a neuron, and the network stabilizes when a Hamiltonian path is found. This implementation is based on the algorithm described in the paper published in **Neurocomputing**.

### Key Features:
- Neural network representation of the knight's graph.
- Real-time visualization using **Pygame**.
- Detects stable and repeating patterns during the network evolution.
- Customizable board size via command-line arguments.

###  How to Run:
```bash
python knights_tour_neural_network.py --size 8
```
- Press **Enter** to reset the board.
- Press **Space** to manually step through updates.
- Press **Escape** to exit.

### Background:
This algorithm attempts to find a Knight’s Tour using a neural network inspired approach. Each knight move is treated as a neuron, and the network stabilizes when the knight completes a valid tour (degree-2 subgraph). While it can occasionally produce a valid tour, it often results in multiple disjoint cycles or diverges.
